I have completed:
1) Hello World Project (React + Spring Boot)
2) Calculator REST API Project (GET/POST, fetch, useState, CORS)

Now I want to start:

✅ Project #3: Student Form (React) + Student API (Spring Boot)
I want to learn this with full explanation, line-by-line comments, and real-world theory:

Frontend (React):
- Controlled Form
- Multiple Inputs
- Form Submission
- useState with objects
- fetch() POST with JSON body

Backend (Spring Boot):
- @PostMapping
- @RequestBody
- DTO / Entity class
- JSON request handling
- Proper REST response

Rules for teaching:
- Explain concepts first in simple English
- Then give backend code with comments
- Then frontend code with comments
- Then common errors & debugging
- Then interview questions
- Then daily task

My setup:
- React is installed
- Spring Boot with Maven
- Using IntelliJ IDEA
- Daily study time: 3 hours

Please start Project #3 from ZERO step-by-step.
